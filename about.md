I'm Jeroen, living in Belgium and this is my blog. Most of my posts are about things I found out and that I like to share with others, they might help other people out.

I'm  working in the infosec sector for a few years now. First as incident responder for a CSIRT and currently more in the field of security analytics and intrusion detection research and engineering.
