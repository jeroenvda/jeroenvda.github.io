I'm Jeroen and I'm from Belgium. Most of my blog posts are about information security or Linux. I see it as a place where I keep my notes, maybe one day others may find it useful.

### More about me

I'm  working in the infosec sector for a few years now. First as incident responder for a CSIRT and currently in the field of security analytics and threat detection research and engineering.

### Contact me

If you would have questions about something I wrote about, or how this site was made, feel free to PM me on one of my social media accounts or shoot me an email on jeroen[at]jeroenvda[dot]eu.
